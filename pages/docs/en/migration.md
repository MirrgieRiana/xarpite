# Migration Guide

This guide explains how to rewrite existing notations and idioms into equivalent new ones so that scripts follow a new API version.

## API Version 5

### `FILES` Now Returns Paths Including the Directory

Up to API version 4, `FILES` returned only the filenames directly under the directory.

In API version 5, it returns paths that include the specified directory itself at the beginning.

To preserve the previous behavior, replace calls to `FILES` with `FILE_NAMES`.

```diff
- FILES("dir")
+ FILE_NAMES("dir")
```

### `READ`

`READ` now returns the entire file content as a single string instead of a stream of lines.

To read it as a stream of lines, use `READL`.
